# To-DO-List
The To-do List is a personal project focused on mastering DOM manipulation using JavaScript. Developed entirely in vanilla JS, this project serves as a practical tool for efficiently planning daily schedules. Users can effortlessly add new tasks as needed and easily delete completed tasks. The interface also includes a filtering feature, allowing users to conveniently navigate through their tasks. Moreover, a handy option is available to clear all completed tasks at once.
